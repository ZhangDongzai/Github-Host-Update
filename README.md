# GithubHostUpdate

[Chinese](README.zh-CN.md)  
A program that fetches Github host to the system hosts file

## Background

When I want to change my Hostuser avatar on Github, my Github won't open, so look for tutorials online. I found the site to update the Github host, but every time I needed to change it myself, I came up with the idea of writing a program that automatically added files to the system hosts file.
